## 💼 Experience

I’ve had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, from **e-commerce platforms** to **government analytics systems**. Along the way, I’ve built:  

- 🎟️ **Ticketing and booking platforms** – handling user accounts, seat reservations, online payments, and receipt generation.  
- 📊 **Analytics dashboards** – delivering KPIs and insights with a touch of **Machine Learning** to support strategic decision-making.  
- 🌐 **Citizen engagement platforms** – giving people a voice to suggest improvements and submit requests for their communities.  
- 🛒 **E-commerce & checkout flows** – integrating payments, analytics, and boosting test coverage with **Jest + Cypress**.  
- 📱 **Mobile apps** – contributing to apps built with **React Native**.  
- 🧩 **Design systems & reusable components** – making UI development faster and more consistent.  
- ☁️ **Microservices & cloud-native systems** – using Spring Boot, .NET, FastAPI, and Node.js with containers and DevOps pipelines.  

Every project has been a new challenge where I got to combine **frontend, backend, DevOps, and AI** skills to deliver scalable and user-friendly solutions.
