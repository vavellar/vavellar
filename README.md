# Hi, I'm Victor Avellar. 

I am a Software Engineer with over eight years of experience developing scalable and maintainable software solutions across frontend, backend, and cloud environments. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and I am currently pursuing a Postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, combining strong academic foundations with real-world engineering experience.

My technical background includes frontend development with Vue.js, Angular, React, React Native, Next.js, Nuxt, and Quasar, as well as backend development using Node.js, Python with FastAPI, Java Spring Boot, and C# .NET. I have extensive experience designing APIs, building distributed systems, and delivering production-ready applications.

I also work with DevOps and cloud technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Azure DevOps, and Terraform, applying CI/CD and infrastructure automation practices. I value code quality and reliability, using automated testing tools like Jest, Cypress, Vue Test Utils, and React Testing Library to ensure robust and scalable solutions.
